# Webscraping

Introduction
In this project, we'll build a web scraper to extract job listings from a popular job search platform. We'll extract job titles, companies, locations, job descriptions, and other relevant information.

Here are the main steps we'll follow in this project:

Setup our development environment
Understand the basics of web scraping
Analyze the website structure of our job search platform
Write the Python code to extract job data from our job search platform
Save the data to a CSV file
Test our web scraper and refine our code as needed
Prerequisites:
Before starting this project, you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming and HTML structure. In addition, you may want to use the following packages in your Python environment:

pandas
Selenium
csv
datetime
These packages should already be installed in your Jupyter Notebook environment, however if you'd like to install additional packages that are not included in this environment or are working off platform you can install additional packages using !pip install packagename within a notebook cell such as:
!pip install pandas
!pip install selenium
